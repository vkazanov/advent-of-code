* Day 18

An unusual parsing problem. The first part is a primitive parser with only one recursive
element: parens.

The second part introduces unusual precedence (addition over multiplication).

* Day 19

The first problem introduces a set of grammar rules that a given string can match
agains. Solved it by a) merging rules into a single tree; b) doing a recursive matcher.

The second one adds 2 recursive rules to the matching grammar. I made the solution more
general than necessary by building something line an AST-based recursive interpreter. In
hindsight, I should have just went with a Thompson-style VM, or explicit BFS.

Adding memoization on rule_id and char index speed up the thing from 1.5s to 0.35, which
is good. The next step would be to remove recursion altogether.

Either way, a cool puzzle indeed.
