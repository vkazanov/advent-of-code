A collection of my [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] solutions.

Typical year directory structure: ={year}/{day}/part{1,2}.{ext}=.

Top-level year directories contains notes on solutions in the README. Usual plan: do
things myself no matter what, then use Reddit or any other tool to look into alternative
approaches.

I also bits of personalized Emacs Lisp to make working with solutions through Emacs
easier.
